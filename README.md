# BirdOS
BirdOS is a new INNOVATIVE operating system which requires to be run by a kernel, but includes no kernel itself.

Basically its just a program which mimics a "os", it has is only really simple filesystem, which doesnt represent any filesystem known, has its own commands (extendable in code btw)
Doesnt have any fun stuff really.
# How to run BirdOS?
Either run the precompiled binary in the releases tab (linux), or compile it yourself
# How to Compile
```gcc main.c -o birdOS```
and then to run it you do: `./birdOS`
